Protocol
Protein sample preparation from cell culture
* I didn’t do cell culture sample before, but get a reference from BD. http://www.bdbiosciences.com/support/resources/protocols/horseradish_peroxidase.jsp 
1.	Decant medium from 10 cm dish of adherent cells and rinse plate rapidly with PBS.
2.	Aspirate excess PBS. Do not dry cells. 
3.	Add 1 ml boiling 2X Laemmli sample buffer 
4.	Scrape cells from dish, transfer to a microcentrifuge tube, and boil for an additional 5 minutes. To reduce viscosity, the sample may be sonicated briefly or passed several times through a 26-gauge needle. Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes to pellet insoluble material, and collect the supernatant (cell lysate).
5.	The cell lysate sample is now ready for loading onto your gel.
SDS-PAGE
1.	Load 50 µl samples to each well (5-20 µg total protein of cell lysate to a 0.75-1mm thick gel; 25-40µg to 1.5mm thick gel).  Load 5µl Precision protein standard.
2.	Set SDS-PAGE running program as constant 80ma for 10min, then constant 120ma for 20 min, till the bromophenol blue line reaches the bottom. 
Protein transfer to PVDF
1.	Equilibrate gel in transfer buffer for 15 min
2.	For each gel, cut 2 pieces of 3MM filter paper to a little smaller size of gel and soak in transfer buffer
3.	For each gel, cut 1 PVDF to a little bigger size of gel, wet in 100% methanol -> diH2O -> sock in  transfer buffer
4.	Wet pads with transfer buffer
5.	Assemble transfer sandwich as outlined below:  (Red) pos. pole> clear plate> pad> 3 MM> PDVF> gel> 3 MM> pad> black plate> neg. pole (Black).  Roll each layer with a pipter to avoid any bubbles.
6.	Close the sandwich board and dunk into filled transfer chamber.
7.	Run transfer at 100 volts at 4°C for 1hr as maximum. Verify transfer through precision protein standard. 
Western Blot
1.	Block the membrane into 10-20ml of blocking buffer for 1hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
2.	Wash the membrane by 20ml of WB wash buffer, 5 min X 3 times with agitation. 
3.	Dilute the 1st Abs in the corresponding blocking buffer; incubate the membrane with the 1st Abs with agitation for 1hr at room temperature.
4.	Wash the membrane by 20ml of WB wash buffer, 5 min X 3 times with agitation.
5.	Dilute the 2nd Abs conjugated with HRP in the corresponding blocking buffer; incubate the membrane with the 2nd Abs with agitation for 30min at room temperature.
6.	Wash the membrane by 20ml of WB wash buffer, 10 min X 4 times with agitation.
7.	Mix A and B solutions (1 ml each) of Chmiluminescence kit before use.  Place the membrane in a plastic bag containing chemiluminescent working solution and incubate for 1 min at RT.
8.	Drain off excess substrate by dipping on paper tower.  Cover the membrane by plastic wrap to prevent drying. Smooth over covered blot to remove air bubbles and excess substrate.
9.	Camera detection using an imaging system.  An initial exposure of 1 min is recommended for film.
